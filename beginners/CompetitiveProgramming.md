# Competetive Programming

  [IMPORTANT : No Prerequisites are required]

  What is Problem Solving ?
                            Problem Solving is the way a person apply his analytical skills in solving
situation with a convenient approach. It is called as competitive programming as several persons are competing to solve the given issue with their programming skills.

  Steps to solve a problem :
                              There are only two steps needed in problem solving. They are :
  1. Understand the given situation or problem clearly.
  2. Then, put your idea to solve in the form of code.

  Platforms to practice :
                            There are online judges which conduct coding contests regularly to improve coding
skills. Short contests last for 3-5 hours, whereas long contests last for 10 days to one month. Even there are contests that will be conducted for a much more long period. Few of the coding platforms are :

1. Topcoder.
2. Codeforces.
3. SPOJ.
4. A2OJ.
5. Codechef.
6. Hackerearth.
7. Hackerrank.

 Programming Languages used:
                            Several languages are available to code. Mainly "C++" is preferred. Next is Java
and C. Other languages used are Python, PERL, Ruby, PASCAL, C#, Scala, Swift, etc.,

Different Topics under problem solving:
                                          These are some of the important topics related to problem solving like
1. Mathematical Concepts like Probability, Combinatorics.
2. Graph Theory.
3. Number Theory.
4. Dynamic Programming.
5. Geometry.
6. Strings.
